# note 4/1/2022 (april 1st 2022)
no this isnt a april fools prank, im finally making this public.
hereelabs was a test of skill after a very nice fellow helped me learn to patch,
it was one of the very few fun things i could do last year during the pandemic.
im very happy i was able to atleast amuse everyone in the hereelabs discord,
i really hope you find this useful!

(im not fixing the sound issue, its your job to do what you need with this. i wont make a patching guide, atleast here. if you're in the [now private] discord server then i will release it sometime.)
