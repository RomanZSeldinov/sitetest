# where is client
client is at the hereebl0x folder, but content is missing. you gotta find it!!! client is early 2014, just find a content folder from then.

# Installation
Install xampp

download the files and drop them into htdocs

go to the hosts file and add

get a content folder from early 2014 and copy it into the game folder

# note 4/1/2022 (april 1st 2022)
no this isnt a april fools prank, im finally making this public.

hereelabs was a test of skill after a very nice fellow helped me learn to patch,
it was one of the very few fun things i could do last year during the pandemic.

im very happy i was able to atleast amuse everyone in the hereelabs discord,
i really hope you find this useful!

(im not fixing the sound issue, its your job to do what you need with this. i wont make a patching guide, atleast here. if you're in the [now private] discord server then i will release it sometime.)

ill tell you atleat this one thing, though.

string search bgiaaa (the public key) and transfer it to a different client if you want a earlier or later verison. you will have to patch everything else, though
