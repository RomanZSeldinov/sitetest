Old files for a old revival. (Which has existed since around 2/23/2021)

# Okay, but how do I set it up?

There is no database, nor is there much work needed to set it up. All you'll need is xampp.

Also, the client is bundled here. Set up hereelabs.cf in your host file. (or, if you can patch, set it to your website)

This was made only for a test back in early 2021. This **SHOULD NOT** be used in any current revivals, learn PHP instead of skidding (or whatever)
