# sitetest
Welcome

uh yeah it has all the important site files for my old roblox revival (which existed as of 2/23/2021)

# where is client
The version of ROBLOX contained in the hereebl0x folder is missing the content folder. I'll go find it later.

# Installation
Install xampp

download the files as a zip and drop them into htdocs

go to the hosts file (C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts) and add

127.0.0.1 hereelabs.cf

get a content folder from early 2014 and copy it into the game folder, or wait for me to find the one that matches the build

# note 4/1/2022 (april 1st 2022)
no this isnt a april fools prank, im finally making this public.

hereelabs was a test of skill after a very nice fellow helped me learn to patch (use x32dbg to edit RobloxPlayerBeta.exe),
it was one of the very few fun things i could do last year during the pandemic.

im very happy i was able to atleast amuse everyone in the hereelabs discord (which is now private),
i really hope you find this useful!

(im not fixing the sound issue, its your job to do what you need with this. i wont make a patching guide, atleast here. if you're in the [now private] discord server then i will release it sometime.)

ill tell you atleast this one thing, though.

string search bgiaaa (the public key) and transfer it to a different client if you want a earlier or later verison. for site, its as easy as string searching robloxlabs.com and editing it to my website. other patches apply.
